## Tagline:
*The people, papers, and moments that made modern computing inevitable.*

## Structure

### Each entry answers:
- What problem existed?
- What did this person actually do?
- Why did it unlock something?
- What wouldn’t exist without it?

### Examples:
- Dartmouth Workshop → “What if intelligence could be described?”
- UNIX → “What if the OS was just tools glued together?”
- Attention Is All You Need → “What if memory mattered more than recurrence?”

### Notes:
This makes ideas causal, not chronological.
