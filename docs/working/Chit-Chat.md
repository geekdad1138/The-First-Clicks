# AI Founders Chat Transcript

## User's Initial Message

Got another interesting idea.  
There's all the history of computing and ai. Like the Dartmouth guys, and then the attention is everything paper.  

I'm a huge fan of just putting everything into GitHub. What could I do that would be almost like an informational home for the founders of computing and AI? Like how we got here. Who clicked the first buttons and why it mattered. Like a love letter to the founders and also a way for people to learn the names of the people who got us here.  

Any cool ideas?

## AI Response

Oh hell yes. This is a beautiful instinct  and it fits you perfectly.  

Youre not talking about a Wikipedia clone.  

Youre talking about lineage. Provenance. Why the buttons mattered, not just who pressed them.  

Let me give you a few strong concepts, then one I think is the idea for you.  

### The Core Reframe (this is important)

Dont frame it as:  
History of Computing and AI  

That sounds academic and dead.  

Frame it as:  
How we got here, step by step, by people who didnt know they were changing the world yet.  

This is a love letter + map, not a textbook.
