## **Intel: The 4004 Microprocessor (1971)**

### **What problem existed?**

In the late 60s, if you wanted to build a digital calculator or a piece of equipment, you had to design custom, hard-wired circuits for that specific task. If you wanted the device to do something else, you had to redesign the physical hardware. Computers were shrinking thanks to the transistor, but they were still a collection of many different chips spread across large circuit boards.

### **What did this person actually do?**

Federico Faggin, Marcian "Ted" Hoff, and Stanley Mazor designed the **Intel 4004** for a Japanese calculator company (Busicom). Instead of making a custom chip for a calculator, they realized they could put an entire **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** onto a single tiny sliver of silicon. It was the world’s first commercially available microprocessor.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It turned hardware into software. Because the "brains" of the computer were now on one chip, you could change what a machine did simply by changing the instructions (code) it ran, rather than moving wires. It made computing **cheap, small, and universal.** It was the moment that "The Computer" became a component that could be embedded into anything—cars, washing machines, and eventually, the laptops we use to train AI.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **The PC Revolution:** Before the microprocessor, the "Personal Computer" was an expensive hobbyist dream. The 4004 and its successors (like the 8008 and 8080) made the MITS Altair and the Apple I possible.
* **Moore’s Law in Action:** The 4004 had 2,300 transistors. Today’s AI chips have over 100 billion. The 4004 started the race of packing more "thought" into less space.
* **Edge Computing:** The ability for a device (like a camera or a sensor) to process data locally rather than sending it to a mainframe.
