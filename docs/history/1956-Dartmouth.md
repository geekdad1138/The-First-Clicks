## **McCarthy, Minsky, Rochester, & Shannon: The Dartmouth Workshop (1956)**

### **What problem existed?**

By the mid-1950s, people were working on "automata theory," "cybernetics," and "complex information processing," but these researchers were scattered across different disciplines. There was no shared language, no cohesive goal, and no official recognition that "making a machine act like a human" was a distinct field of science. The vision was there, but the community lacked a flag to rally behind.

### **What did this person actually do?**

John McCarthy (Dartmouth), Marvin Minsky (Harvard), Nathaniel Rochester (IBM), and Claude Shannon (Bell Labs) organized a six-week summer "brainstorming session" at Dartmouth College. In their proposal, McCarthy coined the term **"Artificial Intelligence."** They gathered a small group of brilliant minds to spend the summer formalizing the idea that "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It turned a philosophical curiosity into a formal academic discipline. It set the "North Star" for the next 70 years of research. Crucially, it established the **Symbolic AI** (or "Good Old Fashioned AI") approach—the belief that intelligence is a matter of manipulating symbols and logic. While the workshop was famously over-optimistic (they thought they could solve significant parts of the "AI problem" in a single summer), it created the institutional momentum that funded the first generation of AI labs at MIT, CMU, and Stanford.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **The Term "Artificial Intelligence":** We might still be calling it "cybernetics" or "complex data processing."
* **The Lisp Programming Language:** Created by McCarthy shortly after, Lisp became the standard language for AI research for decades.
* **The First AI Winter:** Because they set such high expectations at Dartmouth, the inevitable failure to meet them in the 1970s led to the first major withdrawal of funding, which ironically forced the field to evolve and eventually find its way back to neural networks.
