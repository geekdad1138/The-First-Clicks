## **Wales, Sanger: Wikipedia (2001)**

### **What problem existed?**

Before 2001, human knowledge was locked in expensive, static sets of books like *Encyclopædia Britannica* or closed digital silos like *Microsoft Encarta*. These were written by a few experts and updated once a year. There was no single, living, machine-readable repository of "everything humanity knows."

### **What did this person actually do?**

Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched **Wikipedia**. Using "Wiki" software (which allowed anyone to edit a page), they bet on the idea that a decentralized crowd of volunteers could organize the world's knowledge better and faster than a small group of experts.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It created the **Gold Standard Dataset**. For an AI to "reason" about the world, it needs a factual map of reality. Wikipedia provided a clean, structured, and interconnected text corpus that covers almost every topic imaginable. It became the "textbook" from which every Large Language Model learns its facts.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **The "Knowledge" in LLMs:** If you ask an AI who George Washington was, it likely knows the answer because it "read" the Wikipedia entry during training.
* **Open-Source Truth:** It proved that decentralized collaboration could create a more robust system than centralized control—a philosophy that mirrors the open-source AI movement today.
