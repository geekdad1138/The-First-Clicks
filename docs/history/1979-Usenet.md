## **Truscott & Ellis: Usenet (1979)**

### **What problem existed?**

In 1979, the ARPANET (the precursor to the internet) was a gated community for elite universities and the military. If you were a student at a "lower-tier" school or a researcher at a small company, you were locked out of the global conversation. There was no way to share news, ask questions, or build a community across different types of computers without a high-level government clearance.

### **What did this person actually do?**

Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis (Duke University) and Steve Bellovin (UNC) created a system of shell scripts to connect two Unix computers. They called it **Usenet** (User's Network). Unlike the centralized ARPANET, Usenet was **decentralized**. One server would talk to another, "gossiping" about new messages until every server in the world had a copy of the same discussion threads.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It was the first **Global Bulletin Board**. It introduced the concept of **Newsgroups** (hierarchies like `comp.ai` or `alt.soc.ethics`). It was the first place where a question asked in North Carolina could be answered by someone in Sweden overnight. It unlocked the "crowdsourced" nature of the internet—proving that the value of a network isn't just the data it holds, but the people who contribute to it.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **Internet Slang & Etiquette:** Things like **LOL**, **:-) (the emoticon)**, and **"FAQ"** were born or popularized on Usenet.
* **The Linux Kernel:** Linus Torvalds famously announced his new operating system project on the newsgroup `comp.os.minix`.
* **The "Eternal September":** The concept of an online community being overwhelmed by a sudden influx of new users (originally from AOL) was a term coined by Usenet veterans.
* **Modern Social Archiving:** The history of the 1980s and 90s digital culture is preserved today because Google bought the "Deja News" archive of Usenet.
