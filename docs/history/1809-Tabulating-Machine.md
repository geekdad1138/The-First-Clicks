## **Herman Hollerith: The Tabulating Machine (1890)**

### **What problem existed?**

The U.S. Census Bureau had a crisis. The 1880 census took eight years to process by hand. With the population exploding, they estimated the 1890 census would take over a decade, meaning the data would be obsolete before it was even finished. The government was drowning in its own data.

### **What did this person actually do?**

Hollerith invented an **electromechanical tabulating machine**. He captured individual citizen data by punching holes into cards (similar to Babbage's idea, but for data storage rather than instructions). His machine used electrical feelers to "read" these holes and increment mechanical counters.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It was the birth of **automated data processing**. Hollerith proved that data could be "machine-readable." By using his system, the 1890 census was completed in just **two years** instead of ten. He turned information into a tangible, stackable, and searchable resource.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **IBM:** Hollerith’s "Tabulating Machine Company" eventually merged and evolved into the **International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)**.
* **The "Database":** The concept of storing discrete attributes of a person or object on a standard format (the punch card) is the direct ancestor of the SQL table and the modern database.
* **Big Data:** Hollerith gave us the first tool capable of "counting" a nation, starting the trend of using machines to manage societal-scale information.
