## **Vannevar Bush: As We May Think / The Memex (1945)**

Since we're on a roll, here is the entry for the "Memex." This is the bridge between the room-sized calculators and the personal, interconnected knowledge bases we use today.

### **What problem existed?**

By the end of WWII, the sheer volume of scientific research was growing faster than any human could read or organize. Information was being "pigeonholed" in square files and libraries where it was hard to find and even harder to connect. We had "Big Data," but we didn't have a way to navigate it. We were using 18th-century filing systems for 20th-century breakthroughs.

### **What did this person actually do?**

Vannevar Bush, the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, published an essay in *The Atlantic* titled **"As We May Think."** In it, he described a theoretical device called the **Memex** (a portmanteau of "Memory" and "Index"). It was a mechanized desk that could store all of a person’s books, records, and communications.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

He introduced the concept of **Associative Indexing**. Unlike a library (which organizes things alphabetically or by category), the Memex would allow a user to create "trails" between related items. If you found a connection between a chemistry paper and a historical event, you could "link" them forever. This was the first time anyone conceptualized the **Hyperlink**.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **The World Wide Web:** Tim Berners-Lee and Ted Nelson (who coined the term "Hypertext") both cited Bush as their primary inspiration.
* **The Concept of the "Second Brain":** Modern tools like Obsidian, Notion, and even Wikipedia are essentially digital realizations of the Memex.
* **Human-Computer Sympathy:** Bush moved us away from the idea of the computer as a "cruncher" and toward the idea of the computer as a "librarian" for the human mind.
