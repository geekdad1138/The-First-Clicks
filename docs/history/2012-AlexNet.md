## **Alex-Krizhevsky: AlexNet (2012)**

### **What problem existed?**

In the early 2010s, "Computer Vision" was stuck. Researchers were trying to "teach" computers to recognize objects by manually coding rules (e.g., "look for a circle to find an eye"). It worked poorly. Neural Networks (Backpropagation) had been around since 1986, but they were considered "yesterday's news"—too slow and too weak to handle real-world images.

### **What did this person actually do?**

Alex Krizhevsky designed a deep convolutional neural network called **AlexNet**. Crucially, he wrote the code to make that network run on **NVIDIA GPUs**. He entered the "ImageNet" competition—a contest to see which AI could most accurately identify 1.2 million images. AlexNet didn't just win; it crushed the competition, cutting the error rate in half.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

This was the **"Big Bang" of Deep Learning.** It proved two things that are now the law of the land in AI:

1. **Neural Networks work:** If you make them "deep" enough, they beat every other method.
2. **GPU Acceleration is mandatory:** This was the first high-profile proof that Jensen Huang's graphics chips were actually the future of AI.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **The AI Gold Rush:** This paper is what convinced Google, Facebook, and Microsoft to pivot their entire companies toward Deep Learning.
* **Ilya Sutskever:** One of the co-authors, Ilya, went on to co-found **OpenAI**. The lineage from AlexNet leads directly to ChatGPT.
* **Modern Recognition:** Every time your phone recognizes your face or a car identifies a pedestrian, it’s using the "Convolutional" logic proven here.
