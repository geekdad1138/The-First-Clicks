## **Ward Christensen: The BBS & Dial-Up (1977)**

### **What problem existed?**

In the late 1970s, "The Internet" (ARPANET) was a gated community for the military and elite universities. If you were a regular person with a new home computer like an Apple II or a TRS-80, your machine was an island. There was no way to share software, leave messages for friends, or play games with others unless you physically traded floppy disks.

### **What did this person actually do?**

During a massive blizzard in Chicago in 1978, Ward Christensen and Randy Suess built the **CBBS (Computerized Bulletin Board System)**. They realized that if they connected a computer to a **Modem** (Modulator-Demodulator), other people could "call" their computer over standard telephone lines. It turned a single PC into a host that anyone with a phone line could visit.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It was the birth of **grassroots digital culture.** While the government was building the Internet, regular people were building a "shadow network" of thousands of independent BBSs. This unlocked:

* **The Download:** Using protocols like XMODEM (also by Christensen) to move files from a remote host to your house.
* **The Virtual Identity:** Creating "handles" and aliases to interact in digital spaces.
* **Door Games & ASCII Art:** The first wave of purely digital entertainment and aesthetics.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **AOL and CompuServe:** These giants were essentially just massive, commercialized versions of the local BBS.
* **Open Source Culture:** The tradition of sharing code and "freeware" began on these boards long before GitHub existed.
* **The "always-on" mentality:** It transitioned the computer from a tool you use for work into a destination you "go to" for fun.
