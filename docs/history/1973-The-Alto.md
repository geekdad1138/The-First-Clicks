## **Kay, Lampson, Thacker: The Alto (1973)**

### **What problem existed?**

By the early 1970s, "interactive" computing usually meant sitting at a teletype terminal typing text commands. Even the most advanced systems were still "one-dimensional"—you interacted with a single line of text at a time. The concept of a "digital desk" where you could see documents, folders, and trash cans as visual objects didn't exist yet. Computers were still largely invisible logic engines, not visual workspaces.

### **What did this person actually do?**

A legendary team at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)—including Alan Kay, Butler Lampson, and Chuck Thacker—built the **Alto**. It was the first computer designed from the ground up to support an operating system based on a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. It featured a portrait-oriented monitor (to mimic a sheet of paper), a mouse, and bitmapped graphics.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It introduced the **WIMP** paradigm: **W**indows, **I**cons, **M**enus, and **P**ointing devices. It also pioneered:

* **WYSIWYG** (What You See Is What You Get) editing: The document on the screen looked exactly like the document that would come out of the newly invented laser printer.
* **Smalltalk:** An object-oriented programming language that allowed software to be built as "objects" interacting with each other.
* **Ethernet:** The Alto was the first computer to be networked in a way that allowed "office-wide" collaboration.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **The Apple Macintosh & Windows:** Steve Jobs famously visited PARC in 1979, saw the Alto, and realized the future of computing was visual. This led directly to the Lisa and the Mac.
* **Modern Interface Design:** Every time you drag a file into a folder or click an icon, you are using the language invented at PARC.
* **The Desktop Metaphor:** The transition of the computer from a "calculator" to an "office environment" was completed here.
