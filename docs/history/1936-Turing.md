## **Alan Turing: On Computable Numbers (1936)**

### **What problem existed?**

In the early 20th century, mathematicians were obsessed with the **Entscheidungsproblem** (the "Decision Problem"): Is there a mechanical process—a definite set of steps—that can determine if any given mathematical statement is provable? To answer this, we first needed a formal, mathematical definition of what it actually means to "calculate" something. We had machines that could add, but we didn't have a mathematical definition of **thought-as-process**.

### **What did this person actually do?**

Turing imagined a simple, idealized machine (now called a **Turing Machine**) that could read and write symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Most importantly, he described a **Universal Turing Machine**: a single machine that could simulate *any other* Turing machine simply by reading its rules from the tape. He proved that some problems are "undecidable," meaning no such machine could ever solve them.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

He proved that **computation is universal.** Before Turing, if you wanted a machine to do a new task, you built a new machine. Turing showed that you only need to build **one** machine, provided it is "Turing Complete," and it can do anything that is mathematically possible to compute. It shifted the focus from the gears and cogs to the **logic of the algorithm.**

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **The Stored-Program Computer:** The architecture of every computer you’ve ever used (loading a "program" into memory) is a physical realization of Turing’s Universal Machine.
* **Coding Languages:** Programming languages are just different ways of writing the "rules" that we feed into our Universal Turing Machines.
* **The Turing Test & AI Philosophy:** By defining "thinking" as a series of logical states, Turing opened the door to the idea that a machine could eventually simulate human intelligence—a concept he famously explored in his 1950 paper, *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*.
