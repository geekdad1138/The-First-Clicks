## **Jen-Hsun "Jensen" Huang: The GPU (1999)**

### **What problem existed?**

In the 1990s, CPUs (Central Processing Units) were the "jacks-of-all-trades." They handled everything from word processing to logic, but they did it sequentially—one task at a time. This was a bottleneck for 3D graphics and complex math, which require thousands of small calculations simultaneously. At the time, nobody thought a video game chip would have anything to do with Artificial Intelligence.

### **What did this person actually do?**

Jensen Huang and his team at NVIDIA released the **GeForce 256**, marketing it as "the world's first GPU" (Graphics Processing Unit). They moved the math-heavy lifting of "Transform and Lighting" off the CPU and onto a dedicated chip designed for massive **parallelism**.

### **Why did it unlock something?**

It created a "Supercomputer for the masses." Jensen realized that the same math used to render a polygon in a video game was the exact same math (linear algebra/matrix multiplication) needed to train a neural network. By making parallel processing cheap and available, he provided the "physical engine" that would eventually allow researchers to scale AI from small toys to global models.

### **What wouldn't exist without it?**

* **Modern Deep Learning:** In 2012, when AI finally "broke through," it was because researchers realized they could run their code on NVIDIA GPUs.
* **The "Scaling Laws":** We only know that "bigger is better" for AI because Jensen’s chips allowed us to build models with billions of parameters.
