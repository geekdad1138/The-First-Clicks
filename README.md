# The First Clicks

**The people, papers, and moments that made modern computing inevitable.**

## What This Is

A love letter to the founders of computing and AI—a living document that traces the lineage of ideas and breakthroughs that got us here. This isn't a textbook. It's a map of provenance: understanding not just *who* clicked the first buttons, but *why it mattered*.

## The Philosophy

We don't tell this story chronologically. We tell it *causally*.

Each entry explains:
- **What problem existed?** — The unsolved question or limitation
- **What did this person actually do?** — The concrete contribution
- **Why did it unlock something?** — The cascade of possibilities that followed
- **What wouldn't exist without it?** — The causal chain forward

## Examples

- **Dartmouth Workshop** → "What if intelligence could be described?"
- **UNIX** → "What if the OS was just tools glued together?"
- **Attention Is All You Need** → "What if memory mattered more than recurrence?"

## Why This Matters

Most people know *names*—Turing, Knuth, Hinton. But they don't know *why* these figures matter or how their ideas connected. This project fills that gap. It's a way to understand the thinking that shaped the world we work in, and to honor the people who did the thinking.

## How to Use This

Browse the entries to trace ideas backward or forward. Follow the causal chains. Understand not just what happened, but why the next breakthrough was possible.

## Contributing

If you have entries to suggest—a paper, a person, a moment that shaped computing—we'd love to add it. The goal is to make this as complete and thoughtful as possible.
