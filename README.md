# The First Clicks

**The people, papers, and moments that made modern computing inevitable.**

## What This Is

A love letter to the founders of computing and AI—a living document that traces the lineage of ideas and breakthroughs that got us here. This isn't a textbook. It's a map of provenance: understanding not just *who* clicked the first buttons, but *why it mattered*.

## The Philosophy

We don't tell this story chronologically. We tell it **causally**.

Each entry explains:

* **What problem existed?** — The unsolved question or limitation.
* **What did this person actually do?** — The concrete contribution.
* **Why did it unlock something?** — The cascade of possibilities that followed.
* **What wouldn't exist without it?** — The causal chain forward.

## The Map of Provenance

Most people know names like Turing or Hinton. This project explains **why** they matter by tracing the evolution of the machine from a physical calculator to a global intelligence.

### The Four Pillars of the Map:

* **The Foundation:** The birth of programmable logic and mechanized data.
* **The Theoretical Leap:** Defining "Information" and the first attempts at digital brains.
* **The Interactive Era:** Connecting humans to machines—creating the digital "nervous system."
* **The Scaling Era:** The "Big Bang" of data and parallel power that led to Generative AI.

## The Causal Chain: Examples

* **The Analytical Engine** → "What if a machine could be told what to do?"
* **The Transistor** → "What if we could make logic physical, tiny, and fast?"
* **Usenet & The WELL** → "What if we archived the entire human conversation?"
* **The GPU** → "What if we built a muscle strong enough to process it all?"
* **Attention Is All You Need** → "What if memory mattered more than sequence?"

## Why This Matters

We are currently living in the "After" of these breakthroughs. By understanding the "Before," we demystify the technology we use every day. This project honors the individuals who saw the next step before it was visible to anyone else.

## Contributing

If you have a "click" to suggest—a paper, a person, or a moment that fundamentally shifted the trajectory of computing—we’d love to include it.
